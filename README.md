# Thesis-vaccine-predictions
The main objective of this research is to develop a model of an algorithm for predicting the likelihood 
of vaccine hesitancy in people based on their background information.To  meet  this  objective,  this 
research  will  use machine learning algorithms  to  build models to predict the vaccine hesitancy of people
based on their background information

#The main algorithms used in this project were 
1. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Model (LASSO)
2. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
3. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
4. Gradient Boosting Machine 

#Results
 This research aimed to investigate whether background information of a person could determine if the person 
 would be vaccine-hesitant and has proven that a person's background information is avital factor in deciding 
 the vaccine hesitancy rate.In  exploring  thisidea,  this  research  used  Machine  learning algorithms  such 
 as  the LASSO,  ANN,  XGBoost,  and  the  GBM  models  to  predict  the  vaccine  hesitancy  of  people.While
 all these modelsproved the objective behind the research, the  LASSOmodel had the highest accuracy of 84.52%
 and 77.07% on H1N1 and seasonal vaccines,respectively.
